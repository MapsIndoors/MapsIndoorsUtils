  In order to make it easier to work with the appearance of special icons on the MapsIndoors map, we are releasing some rendering helpers in a Utility Library for each MapsIndoors platform. We donâ€™t want to force an app into a specific visualization, so the helpers create a sensible default, with a few options for configuration. If a developer is not happy with defaults or the ways it can be configured, it is possible to create a rendering from the scratch or create a modified rendering with this source code as a starting point.
